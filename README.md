# Paris_Hotel_Selection

**Project Domain**: Tourism

**Tools used**: Python and Tableau

**Type of Algorithms used**: mlrose.TravellingSales

**API used**: Openstreetmap.de

**Project details**: 
  - When booking a Hotel, we normally have a limited number of options to narrow our search (for example: Price, Number of Stars and Brand). It would be helpful to have the distance to numerous attactions when taking a decision.

  - In order to accomplish that, this Dashboard introduced the concept of Round Trip Distance. By Round Trip Distance, we mean the distance from our our Hotel to a First Attraction, plus the distance from this First Attraction to a Second Attraction (and so on...), plus the distance from our Last Attraction back to our Hotel. 

  - As this problems shares a lot of characteristics with the Travelling Salesman problem, we have worked with that algorithm.

**Programming Languages**: Python

**Other comments**: 
  - Project developed only for studying purposes.
  - To develop the Dashboard, a list with almost 100 hotels was used. The idea was to have a list that included different Brands, Number of Stars and Prices.
